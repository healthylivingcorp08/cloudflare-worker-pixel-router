    - [X] Implement middleware to check for valid session cookie on `/admin` and `/admin/api` routes.
- [ ] Add UI for editing specific site configurations (pixels, routes, etc.) - *Deferred*
- [ ] Add UI for viewing pixel fire logs/history - *Deferred*
- [ ] Implement more robust error handling and reporting.
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests.

## Phase 3: Monorepo Migration & Refinement (In Progress)
- [X] Migrate `server_cloudflare_tech` into `ecommerce-monorepo/apps/server-cloudflare-tech`.
- [X] Migrate `tech-ecom/sites/drivebright` into `ecommerce-monorepo/sites/drivebright`.
- [X] Update `drivebright` site from Next.js Pages Router to App Router.
    - [X] Create `src/app/layout.tsx`.
    - [X] Migrate `pages/index.tsx` to `src/app/page.tsx`.
    - [X] Migrate `pages/checkout.tsx` to `src/app/checkout/page.tsx`.
    - [X] Migrate `pages/upsell1.tsx` to `src/app/upsell1/page.tsx`.
    - [X] Migrate `pages/upsell2.tsx` to `src/app/upsell2/page.tsx`.
    - [X] Migrate `pages/thank-you.tsx` to `src/app/thank-you/page.tsx`.
- [ ] Update `drivebright` site build/deployment configuration for App Router.
- [ ] Update Cloudflare Worker routing/configuration if needed for monorepo structure.
- [ ] Refactor shared components/utils into `ecommerce-monorepo/packages`.
- [ ] Test E2E flow after migration.
*   [2025-04-18 12:37:00] - Corrected implementation for `drivebright` thank you page order details fetch:
    *   Changed worker endpoint to `POST /api/order-details`.
    *   Updated worker to call Sticky.io `POST /order_view`.
    *   Changed Next.js API route `src/app/api/order-confirmation/route.ts` to `POST`.
    *   Updated thank you page `src/app/(checkout)/thank-you/page.tsx` to use `POST`.

    - [X] Fixed thank you page order details loading (via worker proxy, corrected to use POST /order_view). This should resolve E2E test failures.


## Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for monorepo deployment.
- [ ] Configure production environment variables/secrets.
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting for the Cloudflare Worker.
- [ ] Final testing and go-live.
