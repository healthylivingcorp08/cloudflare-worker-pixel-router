# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Cloudflare Worker Pixel Router: Serverless pixel/postback routing for ecommerce conversions.
- Ensuring dynamic config via KV, correct routing logic, and proper deployment structure.
- Refining memory bank update strategy.

## Recent Changes (Consolidated & Latest State)
- [Initial Setup - Completed ~2025-04-14]
    - Migrated project files to root directory.
    - Updated Worker to use Cloudflare KV for config.
    - Added logic to only fire postbackUrl for "normal" conversions.
    - Added .gitignore and deployment instructions.
    - Set up initial memory bank & added multi-computer support.
    - Implemented basic username/password authentication using KV store.
    - Created admin API endpoints for login and KV management.
    - Added routing logic in `src/index.ts` to handle `/admin` paths.
    - Simplified the `/admin/login` HTML for debugging.
    - Refined authentication middleware logic.
    - Set up GitHub Actions for deployment.
    - Replaced placeholder `adminHtml` in `src/admin/router.ts` with basic dashboard content.
- [Drivebright Thank You Page Order Fetch - Fixed 2025-04-18 12:36:00]
    - Changed worker endpoint to `POST /api/order-details`.
    - Updated worker to call Sticky.io `POST /order_view`.
    - Changed Next.js API route `src/app/api/order-confirmation/route.ts` to `POST`.
    - Updated thank you page `src/app/(checkout)/thank-you/page.tsx` to use `POST`.
    - Added `POST` handler to Next.js API route `/api/order-confirmation/route.ts` (Fix for 405 error).
- [E2E Test Analysis & Fixes - ~2025-04-18 12:58:00]
    - Analyzed `checkout.test.ts`: Mocked tests passed, real E2E failed due to API issues (now likely resolved).
    - Updated E2E test URL patterns for App Router.
    - Changed Playwright wait strategy to `page.waitForNavigation`.
    - Added explicit wait (`expect(...).toBeVisible()`) for 'Order Summary' on thank you page.
    - Confirmed 30s delay allows test passage, indicating Sticky.io data propagation timing.
- [Worker `POST /` Checkout Response - Fixed 2025-04-18 1:08:00]
    - Identified worker `POST /` returned 302 redirect instead of JSON.
    - Modified worker `POST /` handler (`src/index.ts`) to return `{ success: true, orderId: ... }` JSON.
    - Updated Next.js API route (`/api/checkout/route.ts`) to guarantee JSON responses to frontend.
- [Upsell Page Data Fetching - Fixed ~2025-04-18 2:07:00]
    - Identified `upsell1` & `upsell2` called incorrect API endpoint (`GET /api/checkout`) causing 404s and state issues.
    - Modified worker (`src/index.ts`) to handle `GET /api/order-details/:orderId`.
    - Modified Next.js API route (`/api/order-confirmation/route.ts`) to handle GET requests and proxy to worker.
    - Simplified `upsell1` & `upsell2` pages (`*.tsx`) removing initial data fetch logic.
    - Analyzed `upsell3` - no fix needed.
- [Thank You Page Loading - Fixed 2025-04-18 18:50:00]
    - Identified `isLoading` state was incorrectly initialized (`false`), causing premature error display.
    - Corrected `isLoading` initial state in `thank-you/page.tsx` to `true`.
- [Documentation - 2025-04-19 10:47:25]
    - Created `routing_logic.md` explaining the request routing in `src/index.ts`.
- [Admin UI Enhancement - 2025-04-20 18:01:43]
    - Integrated `sonner` toast notifications into `CreateSiteDialog`, `AddKVDialog`, `EditKVDialog`, `DeleteKVDialog`.

## Open Questions/Issues
- Need user to deploy the latest changes and test the login flow again to confirm the dashboard page loads correctly after login. (From [2025-04-14 20:39:00])
- Consider Sticky.io API data propagation delay (~30s) observed in E2E tests for thank you page data availability. (From [2025-04-18 3:29:00])

[2025-04-19 11:39:39] - Identified initial checkout component path: `../tech-ecom/ecommerce-monorepo/sites/drivebright/src/app/page.tsx`. Currently modifying upsell/checkout flow to pass order details via client-side state instead of refetching.

[2025-04-19 12:14:46] - Confirmed checkout component pattern: Main checkout form components are typically located within `sites/[site-name]/src/components/` (e.g., `CheckoutForm.tsx`). Checkout-related pages are grouped under `sites/[site-name]/src/app/(checkout)/`. Initial order creation API is typically at `sites/[site-name]/src/app/api/checkout/route.ts`.

[2025-04-19 12:19:47] - Refactored 'drivebright' site: Moved `CheckoutForm.tsx` to `src/components/checkout/` and updated import paths (e.g., in `src/app/page.tsx`) to align with the established organizational pattern.

[2025-04-20 18:03:42] - **Current Focus:** Phase 2 (Admin UI Enhancement) - Add loading states to buttons within the KV management dialogs (`CreateSiteDialog`, `AddKVDialog`, `EditKVDialog`, `DeleteKVDialog`) to provide visual feedback during API operations.
[2025-04-20 18:03:42] - **Next Steps:** After adding loading states, refine error handling for API calls within the dialogs.
[2025-04-20 21:49:00] - Verified that `handleCreateSiteConfig` in `src/admin/api/config.ts` already correctly uses `config/site_template.json` for new site creation. No changes were needed for the previous task.
