  "description_summary": "Pass stickyBaseUrl fetched from KV to src/lib/sticky.ts functions.",
  "description_detailed": "In the request handlers modified in the previous task (`task-sticky-kv-fetch-08`), take the `stickyBaseUrl` value obtained from KV and pass it as the `baseUrl` argument when calling the refactored functions in `src/lib/sticky.ts` (which were updated in `task-sticky-refactor-01`). Ensure the correct URL is passed for each API call.",

    "reasoning": "This task connects the KV fetching logic with the refactored Sticky.io library functions, completing the dynamic URL integration.",

  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Request handlers modified in `task-sticky-kv-fetch-08` correctly pass the fetched `stickyBaseUrl` to the appropriate functions in `src/lib/sticky.ts`.",
    "Calls to `src/lib/sticky.ts` functions use the dynamically fetched URL, not a hardcoded one.",
    "The application functions correctly, making API calls to the site-specific Sticky.io endpoints retrieved from KV."
