  "description_summary": "Update documentation for KV-based stickyBaseUrl configuration.",
  "description_detailed": "Update relevant project documentation (e.g., README.md, memory-bank/systemPatterns.md, potentially comments in handlers or KV population scripts) to reflect that the Sticky.io base URL is now configured per-site using Cloudflare KV. Explain the KV key pattern (`{siteId}_stickyBaseUrl`), how it's fetched, and how to manage its value (e.g., via population scripts or admin UI if applicable). Remove any outdated documentation referring to file-based configuration for this URL.",
