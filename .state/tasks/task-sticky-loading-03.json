  "status": "Pending",
  "assignedTo": null,
  "dependsOn": [
    "task-sticky-config-02"
  ],
  "description_summary": "Update config loading logic (src/config.ts?) to read stickyBaseUrl.",
  "description_detailed": "Modify the code responsible for loading and parsing site configuration files (likely within `src/config.ts` or related modules). Ensure that the `stickyBaseUrl` field added in the previous task is correctly read from the JSON files and included in the resulting site configuration object used by the application.",
  "context": {
    "relevantFiles": [
      "src/config.ts",
      "src/types.ts"
    ],
    "reasoning": "This task connects the configuration file changes to the application's runtime configuration state.",
    "additionalInfo": "The exact implementation depends on how configurations are currently loaded (e.g., reading files directly, using a library). The loaded configuration object should now expose the `stickyBaseUrl`."
  },
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "The configuration loading mechanism successfully reads the `stickyBaseUrl` from site JSON files.",
    "The in-memory representation of a site's configuration includes the `stickyBaseUrl` value.",
    "The code compiles without type errors related to the new configuration field."
