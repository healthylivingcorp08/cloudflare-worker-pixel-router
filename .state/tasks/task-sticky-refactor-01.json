  "description_summary": "Refactor src/lib/sticky.ts to accept stickyBaseUrl dynamically.",
  "description_detailed": "Modify functions in `src/lib/sticky.ts` that currently use the hardcoded `stickyBaseUrl` constant. These functions should instead accept the base URL as a parameter. Identify all relevant functions (e.g., `newOrder`, `get_order_details`, etc.).",

    "reasoning": "The core logic for Sticky.io API interaction resides here and needs modification to remove the hardcoded URL.",
    "additionalInfo": "The constant `stickyBaseUrl` needs to be removed or its usage replaced."

    "The hardcoded `stickyBaseUrl` constant is removed or no longer directly used by API call functions in src/lib/sticky.ts.",
    "Functions making calls to the Sticky.io API accept a `baseUrl: string` parameter.",
    "Existing unit tests for `src/lib/sticky.ts` (if any) are updated and pass."
