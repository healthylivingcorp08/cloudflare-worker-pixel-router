The primary issue, "Transaction state not found," was traced back to an inconsistent KV store key usage for PixelState. The checkout.ts handler (and previously actions.ts) was using txn_${internal_txn_id} as the key, while other handlers (paypalReturn.ts, upsell.ts) were correctly using internal_txn_id. This meant the state written by checkout.ts was not being found by subsequent handlers.

Additionally, several TypeScript errors arose from type mismatches and missing fields/configurations.

The following cumulative changes address these issues:

src/handlers/checkout.ts:

Critical Fix: Changed the KV store key for PixelState from txn_${internal_txn_id} to use internal_txn_id directly. This aligns it with other handlers.
Removed unused imports for PaymentData and EncryptedData.
Refactored card payment detail extraction to use the creditCard object from the CheckoutRequestPayload type.
Ensured siteId from the request body is stored in PixelState.
The handler now attempts to read existing state first, updating it if found, or initializing new state otherwise.
The alt_pay_return_url for PayPal now correctly points to /api/paypal_return and includes internal_txn_id and sticky_url_id.
Ensured gatewayId from the initial transaction is stored in PixelState.
src/actions.ts:

Critical Fix: Changed the KV store key for PixelState from txn_${internal_txn_id} to use internal_txn_id directly.
Added guards (if (env.PIXEL_CONFIG)) before accessing env.PIXEL_CONFIG.get(...) to handle cases where PIXEL_CONFIG might not be bound.
Corrected state.processed_Initial to state.processedInitial to match PixelState definition.
src/types.ts:

Added "paypal_redirect" to the PixelState.status union type.
Made UpsellRequest.sticky_url_id optional (sticky_url_id?: string;).
Added siteId?: string; to PixelState.
Added PIXEL_CONFIG?: KVNamespace; to Env.
Ensured processedInitial and processed_Upsell_N fields are defined in PixelState.
src/handlers/upsell.ts:

Removed parseInt() for upsellData.step as it's already a number; adjusted string concatenation for alt_pay_return_url.
Removed the declare module '../types' block for UpsellRequest as sticky_url_id is now correctly typed in src/types.ts.
Improved stickyUrlId determination (header, then body, then potentially state).
Ensured internal_txn_id is included in error responses.
Corrected previousOrderIdForUpsell logic for card upsells.
Updated PixelState after PayPal upsell to store the new stickyOrderId.
src/handlers/paypalReturn.ts: (Previous changes maintained)

Redirects to /upsell1 with internal_txn_id, orderId (initial Sticky order ID), and sticky_url_id.
Uses internal_txn_id consistently as the KV key.
With these comprehensive changes, the KV key inconsistency is resolved, all identified TypeScript errors are addressed, and the overall data flow and state management for PayPal and card checkouts/upsells should be more robust and correct. The "Transaction state not found" error should no longer occur due to key mismatches.
